            p.page-text Outsourcing and outstaffing, what’s the main difference? Both terms are pretty much interrelated and they all mean hiring a company for a remote work or an individual who’s working distantly. However, there’s a slight difference between these two terms. 
            p.page-text IT Outsourcing or Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) refers to a practice of hiring a 3rd party company or an employee outside the house to handle some tasks or a set of activities for your company. 
            p.page-text The advantages of using outsourcing services is that it allows your company to concentrate on more important business activities inhouse or acquire some new skills from the outsourced team or individual that is hired.
            p.page-text Thus, you can bring more opportunities to your staff workers, gain more revenue for your company without significant investments and paying for inhouse trainings etc.
            p.page-text.mb-50 The major advantage of using outsourcing services is that it saves much investment and time for a business. Lots of big and small companies resort to outsourcing since this is more efficient to outsource jobs than hire a full-time employee and train him or hire an expert on a full-time basis.
