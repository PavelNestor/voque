          p.page-text.page-text_bold Custom SSP Development ServicesCustom DSP gives you a wide range of opportunities:
        .dual__cel
          p.page-text A key goal of an SSP is to help publishers manage programmatic/unsold inventory, boost its revenue and sell it to the right 3rd party ad network.  
          p.page-text If you want to gain control over your inventory Supply Side Platform (SSP) is the right solution to monitor how effectively it’s sold and delivered to an ad network.
          p.page-text By using an SSP, a publisher can sell their premium inventory directly to advertiser, while remnant inventory is left for ad networks that is sold via DSP. 
          p.page-text SSPs help publishers to sell their inventory at the most efficient price since publishers can show
          p.page-text clear stats to advertiser as to how their website content performs.
          p.page-text The data obtained through SSP platform includes a wide range of statistics such as: 
            - time, visitors spent on a site;
            - number of pages visitor views per session;
            - amount of returning visitors to your site;

          p.page-text.page-text_bold So how basically the selling/buying process looks like?
          p.page-text Auction within an SSP occurs via bid request and bidders via DSP make a decision on what inventory to bid in real time. So when buyers bids through DSP, a buyer with the highest bid wins an auction and thus an ad is shown to a particular buyer.
          p.page-text.page-text_bold What are the benefits of obtaining a custom SSP platform?
